### Third party sensors example

This folder is for the sensors made by third party, examples code may had fixed, **developers can submit Push Request to this folder**.

- Separate source code and examples, source code (.h / .c / .cpp etc.) in src folder, example (.ino files) in examples folder with sensor type;
- Before PR, please make sure your examples can compile at least.

Currently with following sensors:
